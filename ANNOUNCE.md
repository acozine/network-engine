The Ansible Network team is pleased to announce that the initial release of the Network Engine Ansible role is now available in Ansible Galaxy!

What is it?
----------------------------------
Network Engine is an Ansible Role, a collection of related tasks, methods, plugins, and modules in a standard format. The Network Engine Role provides the fundamental building block for automating network management with Ansible using a data-model-driven approach. Network Engine extracts elements of network device information (state, configuration, etc.) and returns them as Ansible facts in a JSON data structure, ready to be added to your inventory host facts and/or consumed by Ansible tasks and templates. Network Engine is platform-agnostic - you can use it on any Ansible-managed network device. With the Network Engine role, and other Roles built around it, you can normalize your Ansible facts across network platforms.

How do I get it?
----------------------------------
Via Ansible Galaxy using the following Linux command:
ansible-galaxy install ansible-network.network-engine
